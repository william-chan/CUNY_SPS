Knowledge and Visual Analytics
==============================

Copied from http://sps.cuny.edu/courses/is_608

"In this course students will learn non-statistical aspects of elucidating from data its information content which leads to knowledge. Several differing visual techniques will be examined to gain this knowledge through exploratory use of visualizations as well as visualization techniques for presenting data to a variety of stakeholders. Exploratory techniques look to find patterns in the data. Finding patterns that underlie the systemâ€™s characteristics when the data sets are very large or have many dimensions by reducing the dimensionality in intelligent ways is a complex task that often includes user direction. Presentation visualizations provide the viewer with useful information and knowledge since the visualizations are created with context in mind. In addition, students will learn how to integrate quantitative and qualitative data (e.g., text and narrative)."
